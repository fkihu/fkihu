Hello! This is my official Github page. Welcome.
- I'm passionate about data and naturally drawn to data science, a really interesting field. I am keen to learning as much as I can.
- Having finished a one year long Data Science training program in Moringa School, I am already practising what I learned at work. It is amazing!
- I am comfortable with Python, SQL, Power BI, QlikSense, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn and more.
- You can reach me at fredkihu05@gmail.com
